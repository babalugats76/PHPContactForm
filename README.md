#Summary

This project shows you how to create a simple contact form using PHP.

#What you will learn

You will learn the basics of HTML forms as well as how PHP can be used to perform powerful, useful tasks.

Specifically, you will study and make modifications to code that programmatically takes user input and uses it to compose and send an email.

#Installation

This is a 'Skeleton Project' which requires the following steps to get up and running:

1. Download the code from GitHub by clicking on the 'Download ZIP' button or via the following URL: https://github.com/babalugats76/PHPContactForm/archive/master.zip

2. Extract files from **PHPContactForm-master.zip** by right-clicking and selecting 'Extract All'

3. Open Dreamweaver

4. Select and drag the files from the archive into the 'Files' tab in Dreamweaver.  Make sure you are using your wheatridgehighschool.net site and that you are placing the files under the site's main directory using the 'Local View.'

5. Click on contact.php and make the following changes:
    * Update **line #5** replacing 'Student Name' with your name, e.g., `<title>Contact Form - James Colestock</title>`
    * Update **line #28** to reflect your email address, e.g. `$to = 'james@colestock.com';`

6. Save and Publish
    * Save the changes: **File->Save All**
    * From Dreamweaver, **put** the files to your website

7. Test the Contact Form
    * Navigate to the form in your web browser, e.g., http://wheatridgehighschool.net/students/jamesc/contact.php, fill out the contact form and press submit.  Please be patient, it normally takes about a minute from the time an email is sent until it is delivered.
